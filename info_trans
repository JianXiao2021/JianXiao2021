I'm programming in C. I have a character array, it may be empty (already memset to all zero) or have a string in it (ends with '\0'). Now I have another string (ends with '\0'), I want to add the string to the front of the character array.  Furthermore, if there's already a string in the array, the added string should be separated from the original string by a '/'. For example, let the string to be added be "case1". if the original character array is empty, the final string I get is "case1"; if the original character array already contains a string "choice2/case2", the final string I get is "case1/choice2/case2". Furthermore, you should prevent any possible buffer flow. Suppose the size of the array is 'totalPathLen', before actually add the new string to the array, you should first calculate the size of the final string and store it in a variable 'actualPathLen'. If 'actualPathLen' is greater than 'totalPathLen', you should return an error. Please write the code for me, thank you.
